# Yassine Gharbi & Guillaume de Montgolfier — e-Portfolio

## Live Demo

Deployed application:

https://k2vm-229.mde.epf.fr/

---

## Overview

This project is a web application built with FastAPI that allows users to create and manage a personal e-portfolio.

The platform provides both public and private features:

* User registration
* Secure authentication
* Personal profile management
* Experience management
* Education management
* Public portfolio publication
* Portfolio search system
* Portfolio pagination system

The application follows a classic web architecture with a FastAPI backend, Jinja2 templates for rendering, and PostgreSQL for data persistence in Docker. SQLite remains available as a fallback for local runs outside Docker.

| --------------- | ----------- |
| id              | Primary Key |
| name            | String      |
| first_name      | String      |
| birth_date      | Date        |
| mail            | String      |
| phone           | String      |
| hashed_password | String      |

### Experience

| Field       | Type        |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| id          | Primary Key |
| title       | String      |
| company     | String      |
| date_start  | Date        |
| date_end    | Date        |
| description | String      |
| user_id     | Foreign Key |

### Education

| Field       | Type        |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| id          | Primary Key |
| school_name | String      |
| major       | String      |
| date_start  | Date        |
| date_end    | Date        |

---

## Relationships

### User → Experience (1:N)

A user can own multiple professional experiences.

### User → Education (1:N)

A user can own multiple education entries.

Relationship rules:

* One experience belongs to one user.
* One education entry belongs to one user.
* Deleting a user removes access to their associated records.

## Local Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd e-portfolio
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Windows:

```bash
env\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Dependencies

This section explains the key dependencies and why they were chosen.

### Core Framework

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `fastapi` | Web framework — chosen for its automatic OpenAPI docs, native Pydantic integration, and async support |
| `uvicorn` | ASGI server used to run the FastAPI app in production |
| `starlette` | Underlying toolkit FastAPI is built on (routing, middleware, static files) |
| `jinja2` | HTML templating engine for server-side rendering |
| `python-multipart` | Required to handle HTML form submissions (login, registration) |

### Database

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `sqlmodel` | ORM chosen for its dual role: defines models used both as database tables and as Pydantic validation schemas, avoiding code duplication |
| `sqlalchemy` | Underlying database engine used by SQLModel |
| `alembic` | Applies versioned and reproducible database schema migrations |
| `psycopg` | PostgreSQL driver used by SQLAlchemy in Docker |
| `greenlet` | Required by SQLAlchemy for async context support |

### Security

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `argon2-cffi` | Argon2 password hashing — chosen over bcrypt or SHA-256 for its resistance to GPU and ASIC brute-force attacks (memory-hard algorithm) |
| `pwdlib` | High-level wrapper around argon2-cffi for password hashing/verification |
| `pyjwt` | JWT token generation and verification for stateless authentication |
| `python-dotenv` | Loads environment variables (secret key, config) from a `.env` file |

### Validation

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `pydantic` | Data validation library, used natively by FastAPI for request/response schemas |
| `annotated-types` | Extends Python type annotations, used internally by Pydantic |

### Dev & CLI

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `fastapi-cli` | Provides the `fastapi run` and `fastapi dev` commands |
| `click`, `typer`, `rich` | CLI utilities used internally by fastapi-cli |
| `watchfiles` | File watching for hot-reload in development mode |

> **Note:** Some packages in `requirements.txt` are transitive dependencies (automatically installed by the packages above) and are not imported directly in the application code.

### 4. Start the Application

```bash
fastapi dev
```

Application available at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

---

## Docker Deployment

Docker Compose starts three containers:

* `eportfolio-app`: the FastAPI application, available on port `8000`.
* `eportfolio-db`: PostgreSQL, available on port `5432` and persisted in the `postgres_data` Docker volume.
* `eportfolio-pgadmin`: pgAdmin, available on port `5050` and persisted in the `pgadmin_data` Docker volume.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, then replace `SECRET_KEY`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD`. `SECRET_KEY` must contain at least 32 characters and cannot keep the example placeholder. Docker Compose deliberately refuses to start when required variables are absent. The real `.env` file is ignored by Git and must remain local to each developer or deployment server.

Linux/macOS:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
chmod 600 .env
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

For production, use the following security settings:

```dotenv
APP_ENV=production
COOKIE_SECURE=true
SEED_DEMO_DATA=false
```

`COOKIE_SECURE` defaults to `true` and demonstration seeding defaults to `false` when `APP_ENV=production`. Development keeps HTTP cookies and sample data available unless these values are explicitly overridden.

### Build Image

```bash
docker build -t e-portfolio .
```

### Start Container

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Rebuild Container

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

### Check Services

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f
```

### Connect to PostgreSQL

Use `localhost:5432` from a database client such as DBeaver or pgAdmin. The database name, user, password, and exposed port are configured in `.env`. PostgreSQL is bound to the host's loopback interface, so its port is not publicly exposed by the server.

To open a SQL shell inside the database container:

```bash
docker compose exec db psql -U eportfolio -d eportfolio
```

`docker compose down` keeps the database. Use `docker compose down -v` only when you intentionally want to delete the PostgreSQL data volume.

### Open pgAdmin

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5050` and sign in with `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL` and `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` from `.env`.

On the first connection, register the PostgreSQL server with these values:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | `ePortfolio` |
| Host name/address | `db` |
| Port | `5432` |
| Maintenance database | value of `POSTGRES_DB` |
| Username | value of `POSTGRES_USER` |
| Password | value of `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` |

Use `db`, not `localhost`, because pgAdmin connects to PostgreSQL through the internal Docker Compose network.

### Database migrations

Alembic migrations are applied automatically when the application starts. To apply or inspect them manually:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
alembic current
alembic check
```

After changing a SQLModel table, generate a new migration and review it before applying it:

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe the schema change"
```

---

## Automated Deployment

The production environment uses an automated deployment strategy directly executed on the virtual machine.

Every 2 minutes, a deployment script checks the `prod-vm` branch and automatically deploys any new version.

### Deployment Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "DEPLOY $(date)"

cd /home/yassine/web_prog/e-portfolio || exit 1

git pull origin prod-vm

sudo docker compose up -d --build

sudo docker image prune -f

echo "DEPLOY DONE $(date)"
```

### Cron Configuration

```cron
*/2 * * * * /home/yassine/deploy.sh >> /home/yassine/deploy.log 2>&1
```

### Deployment Workflow

1. Fetch latest code from GitHub.
2. Pull updates from the `prod-vm` branch.
3. Rebuild Docker image.
4. Recreate application container.
5. Remove unused Docker images.
6. Store deployment logs.

### Deployment Logs

```text
/home/yassine/deploy.log
```

### Benefits

* Fully automated deployment.
* No manual intervention required.
* No public SSH exposure.
* Compatible with Proxmox and NAT environments.
* Automatic Docker image cleanup.
* Continuous synchronization with the production branch.

## Notes

* PostgreSQL and SQLite schemas are upgraded through Alembic when the application starts.
* Demonstration data is enabled by default only outside production and is controlled by `SEED_DEMO_DATA`.
* Authentication relies on JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies and all state-changing forms use CSRF tokens.
* Passwords are hashed before storage using Argon2.
* Pagination is implemented on the public homepage and search results.
* Docker is used for production deployment.
